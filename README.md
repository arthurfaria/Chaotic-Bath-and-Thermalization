# Thermalization due to a finite and chaotic bath:

This is a software implementation in `C/C++` that focuses on the thermalization process and the Crooks fluctuation theorem for work. The implementation specifically considers the interaction of a Brownian particle with a bath that is both finite and chaotic.

## Repository content

1. QO_poinc.cpp
 	- Poincar√® sections for a quartic oscillator. Hamiltonian dynamics is performed by applying fourth-order symplectic integration, 
	this published by Ref.[1].

2. N_chaotic_baths.cpp
 	- System relaxation in contact to a finite and chaotic heat bath. The latter modeled by a quartic oscillator. Hamiltonian dynamics is performed by applying fourth-order symplectic integration, this published by Ref.[1].

3. Forward_FT.cpp
	- Forward protocol is done in a system coupled to a finite and chaotic heat bath. The latter modeled by a quartic oscillator. Hamiltonian dynamics is performed by applying fourth-order symplectic integration, this published by Ref.[1].
	
4. Reverse_FT.cpp
	- Reverse protocol is done in a system coupled to a finite and chaotic heat bath. The latter modeled by a quartic oscillator.	Hamiltonian dynamics is performed by applying fourth-order symplectic integration, this published by Ref.[1].
